# images-optimizing-lab
Little image optimizing lab with gulp written in 2016 :grin:

First you have to [install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) yarn because installation with `npm i` is broken atleast on my machine.

Then go to the directory of this project and run `yarn`. This will install all dependencies for you.

Next you should run `yarn run gulp`. This command will optimize all pictures inside todo folder and put optimized images in done folder.
